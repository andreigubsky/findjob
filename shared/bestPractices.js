/**Best Practices
 * 
Monitor Cache Performance: Regularly monitor the performance of your Redis cache to ensure it is providing the desired benefits.
Appropriate Cache TTL: Set appropriate Time-To-Live (TTL) values for cached data based on the application’s requirements.
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to manage cases where Redis or MongoDB might be temporarily unavailable.
Data Consistency: Ensure that the cache invalidation logic is thoroughly tested to maintain data consistency.
